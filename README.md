# ILA SJC Testing Site  

## What should this "organization" be called?  

The organization name will appear before github.io in our url.  

## What content should we have beyond the individual pages of resources?  

I'm thinking a brief description of the Committee, plus a link to the NationBuilder site and maybe our Google interest form.
